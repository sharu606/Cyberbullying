# Cyberbullying detection

## Problem Statement
Hateful comments can affect peopleâ€™s physical and mental health. We have come across this in our day-to-day life, and the solution we have come up with is to detect such comments and take action against them. We are using a Machine Learning algorithm to detect hateful comments and their severity to take action depending on it. The aim of this project is to accurately identify and flag these hate speech or hateful comments on Instagram (Social Media). The project aims to improve user experience by reducing the spread and impact of hate speech, which can be harmful, offensive, and divisive.

## Description
* The algorithm has 2 phases.
1) During the initial phase, the primary objective is to identify and detect comments that exhibit hateful content. Following this identification process, the identified hateful comments undergo a filtering mechanism, subsequently serving as input for the subsequent phase.
2) The second phase involves classifying the hateful comments based on their severity into 2 levels
   a) High-severity hateful comments
   b) Low-severity hateful comments
* Actions are taken based on their severity.
  - High-severity hateful comments are automatically removed from display.
  - Low-severity hateful comments are tagged as "Hate" and users are given a choice to either remove them from view or view them.
