# Cyberbullying detection

## Problem Statement
Hateful comments can affect peopleâ€™s physical and mental health. This is something we have come across in our day-to-day life, and the solution we have come up with is to detect such comments and take action against them. We are using a Machine Learning algorithm to detect hateful comments and their severity to take action depending on it. The aim of this project is to accurately identify and flag these hate speech or hateful comments in Instagram (Social Media). The project's goal is to improve the experience for users by reducing the spread and impact of hate speech, which can be harmful, offensive, and divisive.
